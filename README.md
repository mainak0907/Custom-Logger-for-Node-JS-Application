Large-scale organizations make use of loggers to keep track of the logs and analyze them.

Winston logger for custom logging in Node JS, which records the logs, and pushes it to MongoDB, where Filtering and Visualization can be applied

This logger code can be added to any project to make the development and debugging process efficient 

## Why do we need a separate logger on top of console.log() in Node JS?

Console.log() only logs the messages to the console. But what if, we had to store all the logs into a file, transport it over the internet, operate on them, filter them, and visualize them? Then Console.log() won't help in such situations. 
A custom logging Library is handy for organizations to keep track of the logs in the large codebase, filter them by priority, and visualize them in the Cloud.
